# WorkManager

WorkManager is a library introduced by Google as part of the Android Jetpack library suite. It provides a simplified and flexible way to schedule and execute background tasks in your Android app.
In this project, I implemented all 3 WorkManager examples to provide you with a comprehensive overview.

**1) One-time work: Use OneTimeWorkRequestBuilder to create a request that runs only once.**

**2) Periodic work: Use PeriodicWorkRequestBuilder for tasks that need to run repeatedly at a set interval.**

**3) Chained: Creates a sequence of WorkRequests that run one after another.**
